# Immunization FHIR Impelementation Guide (Immunization FHIR IG)


## Background:
UNICEF Philippines is actively supporting the Department of Health on Interoperability Resources Development and Electronic Medical Record Systems Capacity
Development through a grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) in connection with the Australian federal government, in developing and implementing the Synchronized Electronic Immunization Repository (SEIR). 

SEIR is a cloud-based system designed to capture and store individual vaccination records at the point of care. This project seeks to improve and expand SEIR to ensure seamless integration and processing of data from multiple sources, enabling its use for informed decision-making, efficient supply chain management, and easy access to personal vaccination records.

As part of the SEIR implementation, immunization data from different electronic medical record (EMR) systems are expected to be transmitted to SEIR via an interoperability framework. The Department of Health (DOH) has identified specific standards, such as HL7 FHIR, to enable this integration. To support seamless data exchange, it is necessary to develop interoperability tools and provide support and capacity-building for EMR developers, ensuring that both SEIR and connected systems can effectively communicate.

Furthermore, UNICEF Philippines, also receives support from the Government of Japan (GoJ), who is also assisting the Department of Health (DOH) in integrating digital health technologies into the country’s healthcare system. A key focus of this work is the development and implementation of digital tools for immunization data collection and utilization. These tools are designed to help overcome persistent challenges in the immunization program, particularly in improving data completeness, timeliness, and accuracy. While national guidelines and protocols for reporting administrative data jare already in place, their implementation at the local level remains inconsistent due to varying capacities—especially in terms of digital infrastructure and the burden of existing workloads.

In light of the critical role that users play in the success of digital health initiatives particularly in the use of digital immunization tools. it is imperative to invest in the development of robust digital health literacy modules. Strengthening user capacity through these modules will be key to ensuring the effective adoption and sustained use of digital health technologies moving forward.
